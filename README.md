- Ant Design

## Key feature
  [React Query](https://tanstack.com/): Utilized for efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the server. React Query helps in:

- Optimized Performance: Minimizes the number of network requests by caching data locally. (In this project the garbage collection time is set to 10 minutes for higher performance and lower memory leak.)

- Automatic Refetching: Keeps data up-to-date by automatically refetching stale data.

- Simplified State Management: Manages server state seamlessly, reducing the need for complex state management solutions.
